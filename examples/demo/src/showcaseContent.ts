export const SHOWCASE_CONTENT = `# PR #2847 — Checkout v3 Refactor

CodeSentinel has finished analyzing this pull request. The review found **3 blocking issues** that must be resolved before merge: one SQL injection vector, one exposed secret in logs, and one authorization bypass path.

## Module Dependency Graph

The refactor split the monolithic checkout controller into four focused modules. Two new dependency edges introduce coupling that did not exist in v2 — both are flagged below.

## Security Blockers

@signal["SQL injection", critical, score: 9.4, note: "User-controlled input interpolated directly into a raw SQL string. Parameterized query required."]
 
@signal["Secret leak in logs", critical, score: 8.8, note: "stripe_secret_key appears in the audit trail object passed to logger.info. Strip before logging."]

> [!WARNING]
> A third path in session.ts:203 allows an authenticated user to skip the authorization check if the request carries a \`x-internal: 1\` header. Any browser request can set this header.

@signal["Authorization bypass", warning, score: 7.1, note: "The internal-request fast path trusts a client-supplied header with no IP allowlist or HMAC verification."]

## Test Coverage

Coverage dropped in the two highest-risk modules. The deleted billing test file accounts for most of the regression.

@kpi[Checkout Processor; 61%; -14%; vs main]
@kpi[Billing Module; 48%; -31%; vs main]
@kpi[Auth + Session; 83%; +6%; vs main]

@gauge["Checkout Processor", 61, max: 100, unit: %, warn: 75, crit: 65]
@gauge["Billing Module", 48, max: 100, unit: %, warn: 75, crit: 65]
@gauge["Auth + Session", 83, max: 100, unit: %, warn: 75, crit: 65]

> [!NOTE]
> The 65% threshold is enforced by CI. Both Checkout Processor and Billing Module will fail the coverage gate on the current branch.

## Performance Signals

Checkout p95 latency trended up across the last 7 commits on this branch. The regression correlates with the new validation layer running full schema checks on every request — including read-only status pings that do not require them.

Checkout p95 latency: @sparkline[38, 41, 45, 49, 58, 62, 71]
DB query time (ms): @sparkline[11, 12, 11, 14, 18, 21, 19]
Bundle size delta (kb): @sparkline[0, 0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8]

## New Dependencies Introduced

## Review Status

\`\`\`steps
- [done] Static analysis complete
  AST scan, Semgrep ruleset, and secret-pattern match finished in 4.2 s across 47 files.

- [done] Dependency audit complete
  Two new packages added. zod is pinned at a release candidate — pin to a stable release before merging.

- [active] Waiting on author fixes
  Three blockers filed as inline comments. Processor SQL fix is in progress per author's last commit.

- [planned] Re-run coverage gate
  Coverage check will re-run automatically once the billing test file is restored or replaced.

- [planned] Final approval
  Two approvals required. Security lead must approve given the SQL and secret findings.

## Author Action Items

- [ ] Fix SQL injection in \`src/db/queries.ts:114\` — replace string interpolation with parameterized \`$1\` binding
- [ ] Strip \`stripe_secret_key\` from the logger payload in \`src/billing/charge.ts:67\` before calling \`logger.info\`
- [ ] Remove the \`x-internal\` header fast path in \`src/auth/session.ts:203\` or gate it behind an IP allowlist
- [ ] Restore or rewrite \`tests/billing.test.ts\` — coverage gate will block merge until Billing Module reaches 65%
- [ ] Pin \`zod\` to a stable release (currently \`3.22.0-rc.2\`)
- [ ] Add validation guard on status-ping routes to skip full schema parse — fixes the p95 regression
